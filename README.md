![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d1c08730-ca60-42d2-9604-5d0a0366ffa2)

Customer churn is one of the most significant challenges facing modern businesses. As markets become increasingly saturated, understanding why customers leave and more importantly, how to retain them has never been more critical. Churn analysis provides a data-driven approach to tackling this issue by uncovering behavioural trends and service-related factors that influence customer decisions. By integrating predictive modelling and actionable insights, organizations can shift from reactive responses to proactive engagement, ensuring stronger customer relationships and improved business outcomes.

## 🏢 Relevant Sectors and Stakeholders
Understanding customer attrition is vital across industries. This project, initially designed for the telecom sector, provides a scalable framework for churn analysis applicable to finance, retail, and healthcare. By leveraging data analytics and predictive modeling, businesses can proactively address churn, optimize retention strategies, and enhance customer lifetime value.
 
## 📘 Project Overview
This project focuses on **Customer Churn Analysis for a telecom firm.** It utilizes **SQL for** **ETL, Machine Learning (RandomForestClassifier) to identify churn patterns, predict future churners, Power BI for data visualization and provide actionable insights.** While the project is specific to telecom, its methodologies can be applied across retail, finance, and healthcare industries to enhance customer retention strategies.

 ## 🎯 Key Objectives
- **Visualizing and Analyzing Customer Data at different levels**:
  -	Demographic (Age, Gender, Marital Status)
  -	Geographic (State-wise churn rates)
  -	Payment & Account Information (Contract Type, Payment Method)
  -	Services Used (Internet, Security, Billing, etc.)
-  **Identifying Churner Profiles** and areas for marketing interventions.
-  **Predicting Customer Churn** using **Machine Learning (RandomForest)**.

## 🪜 Project Workflow
### 1. ETL Process in SQL Server
   -	Created a **database and imported CSV files** into SQL Server using the Import Wizard.
   -	Performed **data exploration** to check distinct values and nulls.
   -	Cleaned data by **removing null values** and inserted it into the **production table**.
   -	Created **views in SQL Server** to integrate with Power BI.

```sql

```

### 2. Data Integration
- After completing **data cleaning and exploration** using T-SQL in Microsoft SQL Server, the final dataset was stored as a saved **query/view in the database**.
- This ensured a live, structured connection when **importing the data into Power BI using the native SQL Server connector**, maintaining **data accuracy and consistency** throughout the dashboard development process.

### 3. 📊 Power BI Data Transformation
- Added new calculated columns in **prod_Churn**.
- Created reference tables for:
      -	**Age Group Mapping**
      -	**Tenure Group Mapping**
      -	**Service Categories**

### 4. 🔢 Power BI Measures and Visualization
- Developed **DAX measures** for key performance indicators (KPIs).
- Designed interactive dashboards to **analyze churn patterns** across various segments

### 🔗 power Query Transformations 

```dax
-- Add a new column in prod_Churn
Churn Status = if [Customer_Status] = "Churned" then 1 else 0
```

```dax
-- Change Churn Status data type to numbers
Monthly Charge Range = if [Monthly_Charge] < 20 then "< 20" else if [Monthly_Charge] < 50 then "20-50" else if [Monthly_Charge] < 100 then "50-100" else "> 100"
```

### 田 Creating a new table reference for mapping _age_group

```dax
- Keep only Age column and remove duplicates
Age Group = if [Age] < 20 then "< 20" else if [Age] < 36 then "20 - 35" else if [Age] < 51 then "36 - 50" else "> 50"
```

```dax
AgeGrpSorting = if [Age Group] = "< 20" then 1 else if [Age Group] = "20 - 35" then 2 else if [Age Group] = "36 - 50" then 3 else 4
-- Change data type of AgeGrpSorting
```

### Creating a new table reference for prod_service
- Unpivot services columns
- Rename Column – 
a. Attribute >> Services 
b. Value >> Status


### Summary Page Measures

```dax
Total Customers = Count(prod_Churn[Customer_ID])
```

```dax
New Joiners = CALCULATE(COUNT(prod_Churn[Customer_ID]), prod_Churn[Customer_Status] = "Joined")
```

```dax
Total Churn = SUM(prod_Churn[Churn Status])
```

```dax
Churn Rate = [Total Churn] / [Total Customers]
```

### Churn Prediction -  Page Measures

```dax
Count Predicted Churner = COUNT(Predictions[Customer_ID]) + 0
```

```dax
Title Predicted Churners = "COUNT OF PREDICTED CHURNERS : " & COUNT(Predictions[Customer_ID])
```

### 5. 🌲 Machine Learning (Random Forest)
-	**Data Preparation** for the ML model.
-	Installed necessary **Python libraries**.
-	Imported data and performed **preprocessing**.
-	Trained a **Random Forest Model** to predict churn.

### Data Preprocessing
```python
# Drop columns that won't be used for prediction
data = data.drop(['Customer_ID', 'Churn_Category', 'Churn_Reason'], axis=1)

# List of columns to be label encoded
columns_to_encode = [
    'Gender', 'Married', 'State', 'Value_Deal', 'Phone_Service', 'Multiple_Lines',
    'Internet_Service', 'Internet_Type', 'Online_Security', 'Online_Backup',
    'Device_Protection_Plan', 'Premium_Support', 'Streaming_TV', 'Streaming_Movies',
    'Streaming_Music', 'Unlimited_Data', 'Contract', 'Paperless_Billing',
    'Payment_Method'
]
```
```python
# Encode categorical variables except the target variable
label_encoders = {}
for column in columns_to_encode:
    label_encoders[column] = LabelEncoder()
    data[column] = label_encoders[column].fit_transform(data[column])

# Manually encode the target variable 'Customer_Status'
data['Customer_Status'] = data['Customer_Status'].map({'Stayed': 0, 'Churned': 1})
```
```python
# Split data into features and target
X = data.drop('Customer_Status', axis=1)
y = data['Customer_Status']

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

### ▲ Training RandomForestClassifier Model

```python
# Initialize the Random Forest Classifier
rf_model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)

# Train the model
rf_model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

### Evaluate Model
```python
# Make predictions
y_pred = rf_model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
print("Confusion Matrix:")
print(confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred))
print("\nClassification Report:")
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
```

### Use Model for Prediction of New Data
```python
# Define the path to the Joiner Data Excel file
file_path = r"C:\yourpath\Prediction_Data.xlsx"
```
```python
# Define the sheet name to read data from
sheet_name = 'vw_JoinData'
```
```python
# Read the data from the specified sheet into a pandas DataFrame
new_data = pd.read_excel(file_path, sheet_name=sheet_name)

# Display the first few rows of the fetched data
print(new_data.head())
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/12f45b3c-0d80-4383-9322-0edf416676a9)

```python
# Retain the original DataFrame to preserve unencoded columns
original_data = new_data.copy()

# Retain the Customer_ID column
customer_ids = new_data['Customer_ID']
```
```python
# Drop columns that won't be used for prediction in the encoded DataFrame
new_data = new_data.drop(['Customer_ID', 'Customer_Status', 'Churn_Category', 'Churn_Reason'], axis=1)

# Encode categorical variables using the saved label encoders
for column in new_data.select_dtypes(include=['object']).columns:
    new_data[column] = label_encoders[column].transform(new_data[column])
```
### Make Predictions
```python
new_predictions = rf_model.predict(new_data)

# Add predictions to the original DataFrame
original_data['Customer_Status_Predicted'] = new_predictions

# Filter the DataFrame to include only records predicted as "Churned"
original_data = original_data[original_data['Customer_Status_Predicted'] == 1]
```
### Save the results
```python
original_data.to_csv(r"C:\yourpath\Predictions.csv", index=False)
```
